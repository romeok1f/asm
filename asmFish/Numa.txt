How to test Numa:

1.) Start Brainfish in the console window

2.) Enter the string:  "setoption name Threads value 36"  (without quotation marks)
    
    replace 36 by the number of cores your computer has (all Processors together)   

3.) Enter "info"
    
    If you have a Numa machine, at least 2 Numa lines should appear, like that:
 
    Numa Hardware Configuration:
    nodeNr.: 0, cores: 18, cmh: 40040, Group: 0, Mask: 3ffff
    nodeNr.: 1, cores: 18, cmh: f40040, Group: 0, Mask: ffffc0000

    If all Mask: and cmh: are != 0 and different, Numa works.



    You can enter "info" also after start, the only diference is that the second and furhter cmh values should be zero then.
